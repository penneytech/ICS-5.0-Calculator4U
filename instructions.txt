You will be creating a calculator app that runs in the console. 

The app must meet the following requirements for level 3 - 3+: 

1) Can Add, Subtract, Divide or Multiply two numbers based on user input.
2) Uses functions and variables to help keep the code organized and re-usable. 
3) Has a user-friendly interface that guides users through the calculation

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:

Choose and impliment 1-2 additional features to add to your calculator to make it a level 4 - 4+

1) **Support for Multiple Operations in One Expression:**
   Modify the calculator to handle complex expressions (e.g., `5 + 3 * 2 - 4`), applying the correct order of operations (BEMDAS).
   
2) **Error Handling for Invalid Input:**
   Add error handling for invalid user input, such as letters instead of numbers, or division by zero. Display user-friendly error messages.

3) **Square Root and Power Functions:**
   Add functionality to compute the square root, or raise a number to a power (e.g., `Math.sqrt(x)` or `Math.pow(x, y)`).

5) **History of Calculations:**
   Implement a feature that allows users to view the history of their previous calculations and possibly reuse the result of previous operations.

6) **Memory Slot:**
   Allow a memory slot, enabling users to store and recall  values.

7) **Unit Conversion:**
   Include basic unit conversions, like converting between different units of measurement (e.g., inches to centimeters or Fahrenheit to Celsius).

8) **Trigonometric Functions:**
   Extend functionality by adding trigonometric operations (e.g., `Math.sin(x)`, `Math.cos(x)`, `Math.tan(x)`) for advanced users who need it for math-related tasks.

9) **Command-line Arguments Support:**
    Allow users to pass arguments to the calculator via the command line, enabling non-interactive or script-based calculations.
